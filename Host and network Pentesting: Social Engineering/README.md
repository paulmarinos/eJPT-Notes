# Fundamentals of Social Engineering

Social Engineering, or sometimes thought of as "hacking humans", it's one of the most essentials parts of
the pentesting cycle. This is because a good social engineering attack can get you places. You can skip
the bruteforce, the search of credentials, hell even forget about using any exploits. Sometimes you can get
an account from someone, physical access to a building and more.

Let's see the qualities a social engineer usually has.

- A good social engineer knows how to build *rapport*: you can get someone's trust in short time.
This isn't as hard as it sounds, due to how our brain works. We'll see the details later on.
- If not rapport, then the engineer might be good with intimidation or fear: many attacks base
their premises on fear, despair and need of "stuff being done tomorrow!". Someone might impersonate
a boss, a white-collar managerial asshole or something along those lines.
- A social engineer owns the place: the trust a social engineer has, makes them look like they belong.
They belong wherever they are. Be it at an office meeting, a datacenter, whatever.

In short: the social engineer is an outgoing, confident and social person. Nevertheless, the social engineer
might not be usually -- as in, out of the work -- like this, but as long as he can be within his work, then
he'll be fine.

# Common Techniques

Some techniques apply to both digital and physical techniques, so I'll put them here.

- Pretexting: ability to stage a scenario where an individual might give information that he shouldn't.
- Emotional pulls: situation where a victim feels forced to do something.

## Physical Techniques

With physical I mean as direct social interaction. It might be through phone or in person.

Some of this techniques are:

- Tailgating: following someone and getting access to a building without credentials.
- The IT guy: Soliciting access to a computer to "check it". The attacker shows up at your desktop
asking to check your laptop, because there's something wrong with it! And if he's IT, he probably knows
more about laptops than you do... right?
- The occupied hands: technique where an attacker has both hands occupied -- usually with coffee -- and
a sweet employee helps him in using his credentials or biometrics. Thanks, sweet employee!
- Shoulder surfing: it's literally that. An attacker looking over someones shoulder and trying to get
something tasty like credentials or private information.
- Dumpster diving: as the name implies, we dive them dumpsters. Looking for cleartext credentials, post-its,
private records, and more.
- Baiting: the most famous bait are USB dead-drops. Attackers throw around USBs for employees to pick, waiting
for them to use them on their corporate PCs.

## Digital Techniques

Some of the digital techniques are the following:

- Phishing: sending emails to people and trying to trick them into clicking on something.
- Spear-phishing: targeted phishing.
- Whaling: same as spear-phishing, but with high-value individuals (c-suite, board members, etc)
- Vishing: phishing over the phone.
- Smishing: phishing over SMS or messages.

How do this attacks occur? 

- Pharming: when a link says X but sends you to Y. For example: [google.com](bing.com) < says google.com, but its actually a link to
Bing.
- Watering hole: a threat actor supplants a trusted site as used that trust against you.
- BEC (Business email compromise): if you work at XYZ Corp, you probably expect emails from the XYZ domain. So, most times
you will click on XYZ domain emails because they're from the company. But in this case, they've been hijacked.

# How to prevent them

Security awareness training is the only way. It doesn't matter if your company has the best firewalls, the best
EDRs XDRs whatever, if an attacker can physically get in, you're dead.

User awareness is what matters most.
