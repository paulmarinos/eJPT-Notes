# Metasloit Framework Overview

<a id=1.1></a>
## Introduction to Metasploit

The Metasploit Framework is an open-source tool developed for penetration testing.

It provides pentesters with a robust infrastructure required to automate every stage of
a pentest.

It's also used by exploit developers to develop and test their new exploits.

The Metasploit Framework is designed to be modular, allowing for new functions to be added easily
by the user.

The framework was developed initially by HD Moore in 2003. It was originally written in Perl.

It was then acquired by Rapid7 in 2009 and rewritten in Ruby.

There are three editions of Metasploit:

- Metasploit Pro (Commercial)
- Metasploit Express (Commercial)
- Metasploit Framework (Community)

<a id=1.1.1></a>
### Terminology

- Interface: Methods of interaction with the Metasploit Framework.
- Module: Pieces of coda that performa a particular task, an example of a module is an exploit.
- Vulnerability: weakness or flaw in a computer system.
- Exploit: piece of code that is used to take advantage of a vulnerability
- Payload: piece of code delivered to the target by an exploit to execute arbitrary commands.
- Listener: a utility that listens for incoming connections.

### Metasploit Framework Interfaces

<a id=1.1.2.1></a>
#### Metasploit Console.

All-in-one interface that provides us with complete access to all functionalities of the
Metasploit Framework.

<a id=1.1.2.2></a>
#### MSFcli

The msfcli is a command line utility used to facilitate the communications between another
tools to the Metasploit Console.

It was discontinued, but the same functionality can be obtained using the console.

<a id=1.1.2.3></a>
#### Metasploit Community Edition

Is a web-based GUI front-end for the MSF console that simplifies network discovery and vulnerability
identification. 

<a id=1.1.2.4></a>
#### Armitage

It's a GUI-based Metasploit Console written in Java.

<a id=1.2></a>
## Metasploit Architecture

A module in the context of MSF, is a piece of code that can be used by the MSF

The MSF libraries facilitate the execution of modules without having to write the code
necessary in order to execute them.

- Libraries: MSFbase, MSFcore, Rex
- Modules: exploit, payload, encoder, nop, auxiliary

<a id=1.2.1></a>
### MSF Modules

- Exploit: a module used to take advantage of a vulnerability and is typically paired with
a payload.
- Payload: code that is delivered by MSF and remotely executed on the target after successful exploitation.
- Encoder: used to encode payloads in order to avoid AV detection. For example, `shikaga_ga_nai` is used to
encode Windows payloads.
- NOPS: used to ensure that payloads sizes are consistent and ensure the stability of a payload when executed.
- Auxiliary: a module that is used to perform additional functionality like port scanning and enumeration.

<a id=1.2.2></a>
### Types of payloads:

- Non-staged: payload that is sent to the target system along the exploit.
- Staged: payload that is sent to the target after the exploit has been successful.
	- stager: contains a payload used to establish a reverse connection to the attacker.
	- stage: the actual payload, responsible for executing arbitrary commands.

<a id=1.2.3></a>
### Meterpreter payload

The meterpreter payload is an advanced multi-functional framework allocated in memory of the target.
Being in memory makes it harder for antivirus to detect it.

It communicates over a stager socket and provide the attacker with an interactive command inteperter
on the exploited system. 

<a id=1.2.4></a>
### MSF Module Locations

```bash
/usr/share/metasploit-framework/modules # built-in modules
~/.ms4/modules # custom modules
```

<a id=1.3></a>
## Pentesting with Metasploit

The MSF can be used to perform and automate various tasks that fall under the pentest life cycle.

We will explore the various phases of a pentest to understand how to use the framework.

We will adopt the PTES (Pentest Execution Standard) as a roadman to understand the various
phases that make up a pentest and how Metasploit can be integrated into each phase.

<a id=1.3.1></a>
### Penetration Testing Execution Standard

The PTES is a pentesting methodology that was developed by a team of IS practicioners with the
aim of addressing the need for a comprehensive and up-to-date standard for pentesting.

[Check the wiki clicking here](http://www.pentest-standard.org/index.php/Main_Page)

<a id=1.3.2></a>
### Pentesting Phases

- Information gathering
- Enumeration
- Exploitation
- Post-exploitation
	- Privilege escalation
	- Mantaining persistent access
	- Clearing tracks

<a id=1.3.3></a>
### How the Metasploit Framework is integrated into each phase.

| PTES Phase                                    | Metasploit Implementation     |
| --------------------------------------------- | ----------------------------- |
| Information gathering and enumeration         | Auxiliary modules             |
| Vulnerability scanning                        | Auxiliary modules, Nessus     |
| Exploitation                                  | Exploit modules and paylaods  |
| Post-exploitation                             | Meterpreter                   |
| Privilege escalation                          | Post-exploitation modules     |
| Mantaning persistent access                   | Post-exploitation modules     |

## Installion and configuration

The MSF is distributed by Rapid7 and can be downloaded and installed as a standalone package on both
Windows and Linux.

Nevertheless, we will use Linux. Kali, Parrot and Blackarch can be used. In neither distro do we have to install
anything, but we should update our packages. 

<a id=2.1.1></a>
### The Metasploit Framework Database

The msfdb is an integral part of the framework and is used to keep track of all you assessments, host data scans, etc.

The framework uses PostgreSQL as the primary database server, as a result, we will also need to ensure that the PostgreSQL
database service is running and configured correctly.

It also facilitates the importation of storaged scan results from tools like Nessus or Nmap.

```bash
$ sudo pacman -S metasploit-framework
$ sudo systemctl enable postgresql
$ sudo systemctl start postgresql
$ sudo msfdb init 
```

<a id=2.2></a>
## MSFConsole Fundamentals

Before starting to pentest, we need to get a grasp on how to utilize the MSF console.

The console is an easy-to-use AIO interface that gives us complete access to the framework.

Every phase of the pentest can be done from here.

<a id=2.2.1></a>
### What we need to know.

1. How to search for modules.
2. How to select modules.
3. How to configure module options and variables.
4. How to search for payloads.
5. Managing sessions.
6. Additional funcitonality
7. Saving our configurations

<a id=2.2.2></a>
### MSF Module Variables

Modules will typically require information like target IPs or ports to begin exploitation.

There options are configured through MSF set variables.

The console allows us to set local and global variable values.

Let's see some common types of variables.

| Variable      | Purpose                                                                               |
| ------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| LHOST         | Our address. Used to configure payloads and correctly set up listeners.               |
| LPORT         | A port for our listener to hear.                                                      |
| RHOST         | A remote host. Our target.                                                            |
| RHOSTS        | An amount of remote hosts. Some modules allow for multiple uses at the same time.     |
| RPORT         | Port to attack.                                                                       |

Let's use the console!

```bash
msf6 > help 
# print the help menu.
msf6 > version 
# display the metasploit version
msf6 > show all 
# print all the available modules 
msf6 > show exploits 
# print only exploit modules
# lets do something practical like a scan.
msf6 > search portscan
# this will list some modules.
msf6 > use auxiliary/scanner/portscan/tcp
msf6 auxiliary(scanner/portscan/tcp) > options
# prints the options of the current module
msf6 auxiliary(scanner/portscan/tcp) > set RHOSTS 127.0.0.1
# sets the rhosts variable.
msf6 auxiliary(scanner/portscan/tcp) > set PORTS 1-1000
# set a range of ports to scan.
msf6 auxiliary(scanner/portscan/tcp) > run
# starts the scan
msf6 > search cve:2017 type:exploit platform:windows
# filter by searching only CVE exploits on windows
msf6> search eternalblue
# searches for an eternalblue exploit
msf6> connect [TARGET] [PORT]
# helpful to do banner grabbing
```

<a id=2.3></a>
## Creating and managing a workspace

Workspaces allow us to keep track of all the hosts, scans and activities and is extremely useful when
conducting penetration tests as they allow us to sort and organize the data.

The console provides us with the ability to create, manage and switch between multiple workspaces
depending on the requirements we have.

We will be using workspaces to organize our assignments as we progress through the course.

Lets see how to do it! 

```bash
msf6 > db_status
# checks the msfdb status
msf6 > workspace -h 
# prints workspace help
msf6 > workspace
# shows existing workspaces
msf6 > hosts
# prints the hosts stores in the workspace
msf6 > workspace -a [WORKSPACE NAME]
# creates and switches to a workspace
msf6 > workspace [EXISTING_WORKSPACE]
# switches to a workspace
msf6 > workspace -d [WORKSPACE]
# deletes a workspace
msf6 > workspace -r [OLD_WORKSPACE_NAME] [NEW_WORKSPACE_NAME]
# renames a workspace
```

<a id=3.1></a>
## Port scanning and enumeration with Nmap

Nmap is a free and open source tool to perform network scans, port scans a more features.

It can also be used to enumerate services running on a machine.

We can output the results of Nmap to the Metasploit Console in a format that can be imported
to the console and later used in our pentesting.

```bash
$ nmap [TARGET]
# perform an everyday scan with Nmap.
$ nmap [TARGET] -oX [FILENAME]
# this will output the scan results into an XML file. this file will be used and
# imported to the msfconsole for later use.
$ systemctl start postgresql && msfdb init && msfconsole
msf6 > workspace [NAME]
# lets first create a workspace before loading the XML file.
msf6 > db_import /path/to/file.xml
# this will load the file and be accessible from the msfconsole database
msf6 > services
# displays the services known to the database
msf6 > db_nmap [NMAP_OPTIONS] [TARGET]
# perform an nmap scan directly from the msfconsole. this will automatically take the
# data and store it in the database
msf6 > vulns
# if we were to find a vulnerability, it will be stored there
```
